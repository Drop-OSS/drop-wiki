# About Drop

Drop is an open-source, self-hosted game distribution platform. It's designed offer all the same features of a platform like Steam.

Don't know what any of that means? Keep reading.

## Open source
Open source means you are free to view and re-use the source code of Drop (in accordance with it's license). 

Drop is also open-contribution, and we encourage technical users to contribute back to the Drop source code, especially if there are features they want that are missing or are planned for later. 

If you want to start contributing, check out our GitHub: [Drop OSS organization](https://github.com/Drop-OSS).

We also recommend join our Discord: [Drop-OSS invite](https://discord.gg/NHx46XKJWA). However, there is a lot of drama around open-source projects using Discord, so we also encourage using GitHub issues or discussions to ask for support or talk about new features. 

## Self hosted
Self hosted means there **is no central server.** Unlike many of the services which dominate the Internet today, Drop isn't a website you go to, it's software you download and run yourself. That means every person that uses Drop **has their own, independent copy**, which has it's own **own, independent URL or way to access it.** 

Or, if you're lucky, one of your friends or family has already set up an instance, and provided you with a URL, in which case you can just head over to [Getting started with Drop](/guides/client).

## Game distribution
A game distribution service is one that... distributes games. Think of Steam, GOG or Epic Games. You can view, buy and download games from these sites. That's what Drop is.

Instead however, instead of a massive centralized website, each admin runs their own copy, and adds *their own games* to their own copy of Drop. Also, there's no payment processing, nothing has a price.

## Platform
Drop does a lot more than just game distribution. As of `v0.2.0-beta`, a lot hasn't been implemented. But, in future, Drop will be able to handle things such as:

- Dedicated servers
- Matchmaking & P2P games
- Achievements & items
- Cloud saves
- Modding
