# Create your admin account
A freshly set up Drop instance will have an 'admin invitation' created. This allows you to create your admin account without having to copy credentials from the command line, or similar.

To use the invitation, go to:
```
{Drop instance URL}/register?id=admin
```

Once used, the invitation will be deleted. If you are unsure how to access your Drop instance, read through [Exposing your instance](/guides/exposing)
